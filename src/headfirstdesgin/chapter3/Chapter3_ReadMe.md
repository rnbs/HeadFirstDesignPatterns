Adds another OO Principle 
5. Open for extension and closed for modification 

Introduces the Decorator pattern :
``The Decorator Pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.``

1. Decorators change the behavior of their components by adding new functionality before and/or after (or even in place of) method calls to the component.
2. Decorators can result in many small objects in our design, and overuse can be complex.
