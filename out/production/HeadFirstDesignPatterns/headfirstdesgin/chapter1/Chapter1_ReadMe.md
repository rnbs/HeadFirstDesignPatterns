This chapter introduces 3 OO principles
    1. Encapsulate what varies.
    2. Favor composition over inheritence.
    3. Program to interfaces, not implementations.

Introduces Strategy pattern 
    ``Strategy - defines a family of algorithms,
    encapsulates each one, and makes them
    interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
    vary independently from clients that use it.``
